# Image Processing with OpenCV

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates basic image processing using the OpenCV library. It loads an image, displays it, resizes it, and saves the resized version. The script serves as a simple example for those interested in getting started with image manipulation using OpenCV.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omm-prog/Image-Processing-with-OpenCV

   cd opencv-image-processing
   
   python image_processing.py

# Ensure that you have an image file named hi.png in the same directory.

# Script Explanation
> The script loads the image (hi.png) using OpenCV.
> Displays the original image in a window titled "Original."
> Resizes the image to 250x250 pixels.
> Saves the resized image as new_hi.png.
> Displays the resized image in a window titled "Resized."

# Note

If the image fails to load, a warning message is displayed in the console.

Feel free to use and modify this script for your image processing needs!
